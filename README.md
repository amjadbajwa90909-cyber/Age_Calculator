 Interactive & Animated Interface

This project demonstrates how to create an interactive web interface with animations using HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 
The interface includes a button that triggers an animation on a boxwhen clicked.

 Features

- A **responsive layout** centered on the screen.
- A **clickable button** that triggers an animation.
- The animated **box** moves horizontally and changes color.
- Smooth transitions and animations powered by **CSS keyframes**.
- **Simple interactivity** with JavaScript to handle button clicks and animations.

 How It Works

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the page with a button, text, and an animated box.
- **CSS**: Adds styling to the page and defines the animation using `@keyframes`.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic of starting and resetting the animation when the button is clicked.
